You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.



class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        //2 pointer approach
        int n = height.size(); 
        int leftp = 0, rightp = n - 1; 
        int maxwater = 0; 
        
        while (leftp < rightp) {
            int width = rightp - leftp;
            int h = min(height[leftp], height[rightp]); 
            int area = width * h;
            maxwater = max(maxwater, area); 
            
            if (height[leftp] < height[rightp]) {
                leftp++; 
            } else {
                rightp--; 
            }
        }
        
        return maxwater; 
    }
};
