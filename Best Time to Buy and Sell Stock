You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5

solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int bestbuy=prices[0],maxprofit=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.size();i++)
        {
            if(prices[i]>bestbuy)
            {
                maxprofit=max(maxprofit,prices[i]-bestbuy);
            }
            bestbuy=min(bestbuy,prices[i]);
        }
         return maxprofit;
    }
};
